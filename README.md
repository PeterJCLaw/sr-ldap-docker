# SR Development LDAP in Docker

This is a development focused setup of Student Robotics' LDAP configuration
within a docker container. It aims to reproduce the configuration used in
production (where LDAP is configured by Student Robotics' [puppet][sr-puppet]
configuration) for use in development and on CI.
